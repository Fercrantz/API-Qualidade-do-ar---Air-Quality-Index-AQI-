Data capture aimed at obtaining the air quality forecast for the next 4 days.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) API is a tool that provides real-time information about air quality. It typically includes data on various pollutants and overall air quality levels.
The data has been captured and sent to a database in Databricks. Therefore, this project should be used in Databricks, or it is possible to replace the tables with Parquet files
